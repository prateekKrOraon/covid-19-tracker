## Disclaimer

COVID-19 Tracker does not collect any personal data, nor does it require access to Bluetooth, and is in no way meant to be an alternative to Aarogya Setu launched by Govt. of India. Aarogya Setu provides government guidelines to fight the pandemic and makes it easier to backtrack potential COVID-19 cases. It is strongly recommended that you download Aarogya Setu too.
